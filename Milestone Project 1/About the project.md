# Predicting heart disease using Machine Learning approach

**Focus** - To build a machine learning model that will predict with maximum accuracy whether or not an individual is suffering from a heart disease based on some medical data.

Data has been obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)
It is also available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

* This project is a part of the online course ["Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery"](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery
).<br>

This short project has been a learning endeavour with the help of the above learning resources. It is just a small step towards entering the world of `Data Science and Machine Learning` and beyond. Collaboration is always welcome. In case you find any mistake(s) in the codes, please let me know.
